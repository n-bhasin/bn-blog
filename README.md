A blogging website perfect for school projects. It is good example of how to work with MVC structure which is having a crud functionality- using nodejs, mongoose, express.js, html, css, bootstrap.  

To run this project:
 1. clone the repository
 2. install all the dependencies from package.json
 3. put your own mongodb database url (using atlas mongodb)
 4. then run the command: npm run servertart
 5. enter the url in your fav browser: 
       (->frontend) localhost:3000
       (->backend) localhost:3000/admin (create your own admin users using database)
